# Policy on Partnerships

#### Introduction

This document serves to set forth the basic principles with which we, Sourcerers Ops, approach partnership opportunities on behalf of the entities we contract our operations support services to. As a firm that conducts business primarily within Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem, the projects we work with are often open source, publicly funded, and very much beholden to the will of a network of community members. What’s more, the climate of regulatory uncertainty places a heavier burden on teams within the space to carefully consider any public announcement. Because of these unique qualities, our job of securing partnerships for others is subject to a heightened level of scrutiny. Below we outline a list of requirements which we take as the minimum in order to consider engaging in a partnership with an interested party on behalf of a client.

These are only the most basic standards used when first evaluating the viability of partnerships. Ultimately, the vast majority of the decision relies on subjective measurements of the quality of the partnering team (Will they do what they say they will do? Is there a track record to prove it?) and the impact that the proposed partnership will have (If we/they do it, how much does it matter? How does it affect the business at hand?). We do not even attempt to codify these subjective measurements below, but outline a series of policies for several categories of evaluation, as well as brief explanations of our positions.

#### Project Roadmap and Funding Status

Given the intense inquiry and lack of regulatory clarity around initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) and related crowdsales, any projects we contract for in the Ethereum space require the utmost caution in evaluating any partnerships that plan on raising money publicly. As a consequent rule, **we cannot facilitate partnerships for any clients with a third party prior to or during a public fundraiser**. The sole exceptions that will be considered are projects which are _currently utilizing_ our client’s technology, or projects providing technology for our client to integrate themselves _immediately_. These italicized terms aren’t meant to be ambiguous - we expect a working implementation on a live protocol/product, or all pieces in place such that only our client’s development output remains as a dependency.

For projects which have already completed a public fundraiser, or those which are privately funded, the expectation still remains that public partnership announcements rely on an integration that _can be_ executed immediately. It’s not required in these instances to commit to immediate execution, however, we should expect clients to commit to these partnerships only insofar as the pace of execution (from either team) falls comfortably within our (Sourcerers’) own service contract.

#### Team and Contact Information

Cryptocurrencies and blockchains, usually serving as public audit trails carrying intrinsic security measures, have historically been marred by cases of security breaches (usually of an off-chain service provider) or even worse, cases of blatant fraud. The complex nature of these cutting edge technologies leaves average and sometimes the most knowledgeable consumers vulnerable to significant unexpected loss with little recourse for formal recovery.

While we can’t ensure flawless execution of code, we can absolutely ensure that every partnership struck on behalf of a client is done only with teams having an established public presence. This includes specifically a publicly named founder or teams with a known history of industry work experience prior to their current project. Additionally, we have a firm expectation that every team we interface with provide some public form of contact address that is regularly maintained.

#### Conduct, Ethos, and Externalities

We find ourselves and our clients deeply embedded within a space spawned from a certain set of shared values. From the inception and dissemination of the original Bitcoin white paper, and through the many developments and advancements of new protocols, the entire industry has been marching towards a world constructed from a certain set of ideals. These include, roughly, the protection and promotion of financial freedoms and autonomy for all individuals, borderless global economies and markets, digital instantiations of constitutional rights, and guarantee of equal rights to self-govern. Moreover, it’s the ability of these technologies to provide a platform for issuance and protection of these rights to _everyone_.

With any potential partnership, we are behooved to analyze the behavior and conduct of the partnering body for clear overlap of our values. This can be formulated from questions like: “Do they share the same vision of the future of the space as our client? How would the proposed partnership work towards that vision? How would it promote the values of our client? Are they proposing a better world for themselves, or for everyone?” - these are perhaps the most ambiguous qualification points for partnership, but generally boils down to a rejection of any project which has shown a disregard for open, free, and inclusive technologies.

Furthermore are assessments of the finer points of the initial interaction. Beyond the values and content of the partnership lies the means of achieving it. Are we being approached by a salesperson, or someone outsourced from the project proposing partnership altogether? Are they insisting on a call before any of the formal details have been proposed? Are they rushing towards an inert announcement, or attempting to build rapport and reach common goals?


#### Conclusion

As stated in the introduction, the framework provided above is a simple rough outline of what is otherwise an involved task of assessing the risks and benefits of possible partnerships. In the absence of clear indicators violating any of the policies prescribed, we reserve right to cease any partnership we’ve brokered on behalf of our clients or, should our clients so choose, terminate the client relationship on this basis where mutual agreement can’t be found.
