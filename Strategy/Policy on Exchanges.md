# Policy on Exchanges

#### Introduction

This document outlines a set of both criterion and more general guidelines under which Sourcerers Ops conducts itself when engaging in partnerships with any cryptocurrency or digital asset exchange, on behalf of our clients. This can be thought of as an extension of the [Policy on Partnerships](https://github.com/Sourcerers-Ops/OSO/Strategy/Policy%on%Partnerships.md). Working mostly with ERC20 token-based projects in the past, we realize how crucial it is to carefully manage associations for clients in an ecosystem awash with uncertainty and unscrupulous conduct, and have created this auxiliary document as a result.

#### Listing Requirements
Dozens, if not hundreds, of cryptocurrency exchanges of all kinds have emerged in the past year and a half. Many of these exchanges have questionable origins and practices, with unverifiable measures of real depositors and trading volumes. Most of these exchanges approach our clients directly (primarily through email) offering listings under uncertain terms whereby our clients have to pay BTC, ETH, or their native token in order to be listed on the exchange. Others may require mandatory purchase of the exchange’s native token, either held as a reserve or consumed in various listing mechanisms. Others still will offer listings only under the condition that some portion of our client’s tokens is either given away as an “airdrop” or used for a variety of “market making services” not worth detailing.

If placed as a barrier to listing, Sourcerers considers each of these scenarios to be a form of “listing fee”, and will direct our clients away from engaging with that exchange under any and all circumstances. 
Beyond these, Sourcerers is happy to acquire and relay any information required to process a listing of our client’s asset. This has typically included all manner of disclosures on the team, the roadmap and development progress, any required public blockchain data surrounding the token (token contract addresses, total supply, etc.) and it’s past or planned issuance. 

Within reason, we can accomodate most special requests for information from clients, or particular preparation of this information into a form provided by the exchange.

#### Promotion and Marketing

Following from the previous section, any form of required paid promotion or marketing for the exchange in question from our client would be considered a paid listing requirement. As Sourcerers also provides marketing services for our clients, we prefer not to have to pay out to a third party to create additional buzz for our clients. Even in the event that these services are offered for free, we insist on keeping our client’s content and social media pipelines clear of promotion of any particular exchange. Where possible, we encourage the exchange to promote the listing event itself. 

With the understanding that listings of our client’s assets can be done involuntarily, with no prior consent from Sourcerers or its client, it’s important that NO listing in particular is promoted as a formal partnership. 

#### Compliance

Several Sourcerers team members are intimately aware of the stringent requirements placed on an exchange’s compliance program in order to remain in good standing with the various regulatory bodies overseeing their operation. Where asked, we are happy to oblige any reasonable request for information on behalf of our clients, and if necessary will provide oversight in acquiring any legal opinion to pass along to the exchange.

#### Other Considerations

To reiterate the points made at the top of this document as well as in our Policy on Partnerships, the ecosystem of cryptocurrency exchanges is becoming crowded with many new players. Many of these exchanges monetize through dishonest methods, or engage in otherwise unscrupulous behavior. It’s of the utmost important that our clients outright avoid engaging with any exchange perceived to be unprofessional or ill-prepared in their communications and conduct. Generally speaking, we’d prefer the outcome of false negatives to false positives with virtually every client.

#### Internal Conduct

Every Sourcerers team member is trained to keep all of our client’s dealings concealed not only from third parties, but even amongst ourselves we share information on a need-to-know basis. When dealing with the even more sensitive information involved in an exchange listing one of our client’s, we take great care to avoid any misgivings that may lead to insider trading, and make overt efforts to place all team members working with that client under the exchanges non-disclosure agreement.
