#### Sourcing

When filling an open service provider position, Sourcerers uses a few avenues for sourcing talent. We base much of our sourcing techniques specifically around the position being sought after. For instance, in recent sourcing for remote Clojurescript developers, we posted on job boards such as [Ethlance](https://ethlance.com/),  [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.io/), and [Brave Clojure](https://jobs.braveclojure.com/). We advocate for our clients to be involved in community discussion for whatever underlying technology they are using. Through reputation and word of mouth, it makes it much easier to attract talented service providers to your project when you are established in the underlying technology’s community.

#### Initial Outreach

Whenever we receive applications for an open position, we analyze their experience related to the role as well as any extracurricular projects they may be working on. Extracurricular projects demonstrate passion for the work, which is equally as important as experience.

Responsiveness to potential hirees is key for continued positive reputation. There is a high likelihood that applicants of the position are already users/consumers of the client’s products. It is therefore important to remember that all applicants may be existing customers or advocates for the client and should be treated as such.

Sourcerers logs all applications to keep track of application history as well as to record suitable candidates should a position become available in the future if there is one not available when they apply.


#### Screening Interview

The typical screening interview consists of the following dialogue:

* Introduction about how we (Sourcerers Ops) came into working on behalf of the client, how we heard about the client, when we signed on, and our function.
* Ask what the applicant does in their current capacity related to the open position.
* Ask how the applicant got into the industry they are currently in.
* Ask how the applicant heard about the client.
* If the client is paying in cryptocurrency, clarify with the applicant if they are able to accept this form of payment and would they know how to effectively use it.
* Cover any expectations set forth by the client
* Discuss a tentative work schedule with the applicant
* Ask if the applicant would like to take on other tasks outside their primary role.

#### Technical Interview With Client

Once a potential service provider has passed the screening interview, the next step will be to interview with whatever stakeholders the client deems necessary. For instance when hiring a software engineer, typically included are the CTO or Technical Lead of the project. Sourcerers provides scheduling services and will engage with the client on pre and post interview feedback.

#### Negotiation

If a decision is reached to provide a contract to the potential service provider, Sourcerers can negotiate the contract on behalf of the client. Specifications negotiated for the service provider contract include wages, start date, benefits, vacation, and any other specifics that the client or applicant would like discussed.

#### Onboarding to Team

Following a successful negotiation with the service provider, Sourcerers will provide comprehensive onboarding services. This includes briefing the service provider on best security practices, reviewing critical knowledge requirements, setting meeting times and expectations, as well and getting service providers adjusted to the general culture within the project. These are all competencies that Sourcerers excels at, and takes pride in welcoming new members to our clients’ teams.
