# Distributing Payroll and Expenses

#### Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a clear understanding for how Sourcerers distributes funds from our client’s multisig wallet, or any other fund storage mechanism, to compensate the appropriate parties involved with their project. These costs are typically broken down into reimbursement for team member expenses, external service provider costs, operations support salaries, and developer support salaries. Sourcerers expertise lies within the Ethereum ecosystem, and therefore for the steps described below it is assumed our clients have built their project around the Ethereum infrastructure.
