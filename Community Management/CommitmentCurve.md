# Commitment Curve

As a general rule of thumb, your community should revolve around a central goal or theme. This initial goal creation will help when engaging and building a core group of contributors. Once you have established your goals you will then start formulating a plan to get your community to those end goals.

#### Start with “Why?”

Get started by asking yourself these questions:

1. Why do you want to build a community?
2. What do you want to achieve with your community?
3. Who is your target audience?
4. How will you motivate people to participate?
5. What will your costs be as you scale this for the long term?
6. Can the costs be mitigated by rolling the overhead into your overall goals?
7. What platform(s) will you utilize?

There are many other considerations you may want to look at but this is the bare minimum for starting your community. Once you have a solid grasp on these starting points, you can begin forming your goals. After you have answered these question and move onto the goals section, you may want to circle back around and answer these questions again to ensure your goals are still aligned with your initial reasons why you are building a community.

#### Establishing Goals

When establishing community goals, you need to ensure those goals are aligned with your project/company’s mission, vision and values. This will guide you in selecting a platform, how you will structure the community and what your goals will be.
To get started ask yourself the following questions:

1. What value does the community bring to your project?
In other words, what are you seeking? Contributors, specific community contributions, eventual employees, or something else? This will help reinforce your goals and strategy.

2. How will you acquire members?
Marketing = Acquisition
This will be different for every project and will depend on the resources you have at your disposal as well as your target audience. This will however boil down to one thing, how are you going to structure your goals around acquiring new community members so you can retain them. This is often referred to as your “Community Funnel” and is generally accomplished by your marketing team or leader. You will then need to figure out how to retain those newly acquired members and ensure they stick around so you can accomplish your overall goals.

3. How will you retain your community members?
Community Management = Retention. You may need to fill both roles with a single person in the early days. Account for this in your strategy and move progressively towards community contributions to fill the gap as early as possible. To do this you will want to learn who your community members are, how you will motivate and empower them to achieve shared goals, and how you will engage or communicate with them.

If you are a single person or at an early stage for your project, you may need to fill both roles of ‘Marketing and Community Management with a single person. If so, we will give some tips on bootstrapping a community using a live streaming channel in the ‘Live Streaming” section.

#### Planning your Commitment Curve

Now that you have an idea on why you are building a community and what goals you are looking to accomplish, you are ready to start the planning stage. This will be an important stage and needs to be planned carefully to ensure you have a solid game plan for engaging and retaining your members.

A strategy that is becoming quite standard with many communities is called the “Community Commitment Curve”. There are many resources on building a Commitment Curve but its essentially a public facing roadmap for contributor commitment that reinforces your community’s end goals.

To start planning, we suggest digging deeper into your target audience so you can start formulating a structure for your Commitment Curve. You can even structure this in a multi phased roll out. This ensures the community has things to look forward to and so you can take feedback along the way. You can adjust things as you move forward to each new phase employing the feedback you receive.
The following questions will help you begin the planning phase:

1. Who are your community members,
2. Where are they from?
3. What skills, professions or hobbies do they possess?
4. What brought them to the community in the first place?

Each of these points will help you decide what direction to take your “Commitment Curve” and make people feel like a valued member of your community. Some people may like gamification, other may not. Some people may be seeking education, other may be seeking to contribute and help build. Some may be seeking monetary incentives or work, others may be seeking recognition and status. Taking early feedback and experimenting with different models will be important but never leave one type of community member out over another. Try to ensure it’s as close to a “one size fits all” model even if it means using a couple different community platforms or social channels.

#### Building your Commitment Curve

Your commitment curve should be largely frictionless initially so you don’t turn people away with too much up front commitment of time or energy.
We suggest having clear levels of commitment for each type of user.
* Educational or information seeking (Largely passive lurkers)
* Active members (People talking and contributing to discussion or content)
* Advanced (Highly engaged contributors, moderators and leaders)

Having a clear path forward for each of these levels of commitment is important. Some platforms even allow the use of bots and gamification to automate this but you can also manually do this in the early stages of your community. Some communities may even be opposed to this so if you do have gamification, make sure members can opt out unless it serves as a specific moderation tool. In which case it should be limited anyway.

#### Organization

While the platform you choose will dictate how you can structure things, most community building platforms will let you organize things into topic based channels. Be sure to give people a way to either opt out or into these channels willingly and keep things limited in the initial phase. Sourcerrers uses Telegram, Slack and Discord as well as many others in the past. Each platform has it’s pros and cons and it’s important to evaluate them during your planning phase.

#### Identity

Ensure members can identity themselves within your community beyond their association with your project or brand. This could include giving people channels to discuss personal interests, hobbies, skills, professions, personal projects or community contributions, as well as where they are in the world. This doesn't need to be right away, many platforms will give you the option to hide things like this from initial members and let them opt in or find them later.  Sorcerers has always given people a channel for general discussions, as well as topic specific discussions regardless of the platform being used. This should be ongoing and based on the conversations you see within your community. You can structure things as you go. We currently have a Random or Interesting content channel.

#### Onboarding

Generally, some form of onboarding process that establishes some identifying information with a low bar of entry to your commitment curve will be vital. Sourcerers has employed a low friction model that can be seen in the [district0x community discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/Gjvw7qU). This can be done in many ways and the platform you choose will dramatically affect the tools and resources you have to accomplish this.

#### Empowering Members

Once your community members are successfully onboarded, it’s important to move them towards goals they align with as well as your project goals as a whole. At Sourcerers, we employ an “Ambasador” program to give people recognition and and “opt in” leadership roles.

Giving your ambassadors special perks and decision making power is important and can often help direct and shape the culture of your community. Be sure to select and onboard your ambassadors or have a seperate commitment level above this to ensure these members are of a high quality. You will know who your ambassadors should be because they will stick out of the crowd and offer help anywhere they can without you having to ask.

Reach out to those people but be sure to make this a low level of commitment as well. Too much responsibility may scare away or chase off these people if they feel there is too much responsibility. Letting them know the program is largely experimental is important so you can take feedback in a low stakes relationship for both of you.

#### Conclusion

Ultimately, you want to establish who your community members are, gain their trust, encourage participation, evoke contritions and reward them. The long term goal should be the same as it is for any open source project, to make it a self sustaining ecosystem. If you can get this to be a self reinforcing cycle and get over the “Chicken and Egg” problem you will be well on your way.

The Commitment Curve we aim for at Sourcerers can be seen below

As you can see the goal is to create a cycle where people build up to a point where they create sub projects that can set into motion the same cycle and perpetuate that as they move forward.

In a nutshell, it's important to make sure your long standing community members are able to perpetuate this cycle and make it as frictionless as possible, while maintaining a low bar of entry for anyone who wants to get involved.

Keep in mind, we are no saying this is an “end all be all” guide, we are simple giving a fully open view to our approach and how we are approaching things. We are always open to contributions and feedback on this model. We will also be changing and trying new things all the time.
