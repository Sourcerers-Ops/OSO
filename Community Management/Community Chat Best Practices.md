# Community Chat Best Practices

#### Introduction
The primary purpose of this document is to give a general overview of how Sourcerers approaches community building for a chat based community. We will cover the tools and resources used to effectively launch and manage the community, as well as some best practices and tips for each platform and tool.

#### OSS Community Management Differentiation
Before getting started, it’s important to understand the differentiation between a traditional Community Manager’s operational strategy and that of an OSS Community Manager’s operational role.  

In a centrally controlled business, a Community Manager is the first point of contact for the greater public. A Community Manager is also expected to accomplish and be in line with business specific goals. However, it’s important to see what the contrasting open source role would look like in a flat organization like a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).  

The following comparison will help to get a better idea of these contrasting roles and the goals they are aligned with.  

Company or business  
* Increase profit margin
* Retain rights and patents
* Capture a bigger market share
* Create value added services
* Provide customer service
* Improve employee training
* Push for consumer adoption  

Open source project  
* Bring value to anyone
* Create open standards
* Increase network effect
* As of recent, tokenize access
* Attract developers and contributors
* Educate and encourage collaboration
* Give alternatives to consumer products  

These goals are in stark contrast to one another. Open source tools have inherently different goals a community manager should align with in an open source project. The following guide gives best practices, tools and strategies for accomplishing those goals.  

#### Getting Started
As a general rule of thumb, your community should revolve around a central goal or set of goals. This will help when engaging and building a core group of contributors. Considering this, you will want to start with “who” your community members are. Who your community members are will help narrow focus on the goals of your community and strengthen the reason why they are there. We will cover strategies for accomplishing the “start with who” method later in this series.  

It can also help to focus on what shared goals you have with your community so there is mutual value being reciprocated. For example an effective and valued community surrounding an open source project will include people in the conversation, make them feel valued, engage them in feedback rounds, polls and voting to ensure they have a say in things as they move forward.

#### Security
It’s important to utilize any and all security features offered by the platform you are using as well as your personal devices and accounts. This includes, two factor authentication, password management tools to generate secure passwords and ensuring this is done across any account connected to your community platforms. Especially your phone considering most community platforms use phone numbers as a primary security feature. Another must have is a VPN, you never know what data you may be leaking when clicking on links shared within a community. This will go a long way in protecting chat room admins.  

Security checklist:  
1. Ensure all personal and professional accounts have two factor
2. Ensure all devices have security features enabled (password, screen timeout, etc)
3. Use a password manager to generate secure passwords (LastPass, OnePass, etc)
4. Ensure anyone with access to publications or announcement channels have two factor
5. Call your phone carrier and ask that they “Do not port under any circumstances”
6. Ensure a pin is used instead of your social.
7. Change passwords periodically.
8. Use a VPN at all times.

#### Platforms
Sourcerers has used and implemented all of the following platforms. Each OSS project will have a different demographic and require a different approach to platforms required.  

* Slack
* Telegram
* Discord
* RocketChat
* Wechat

#### Platforms and Moderation
While moderation strategy is important, the largest defining factor of your strategy will revolve around the tools you have at your disposal and how you structure your community on each platform. This takes time to learn the tools on each platform and will be different for every project. Often times, third party solutions will be the only way to properly moderate on any platform so you will want to look into the tools available to each platform. We will now cover each platform with a description of each and the moderation tools at your disposal.  

Choosing a platform  

In addition to moderation considerations, It’s best to analyze your target audience to see what your demographic is. In other words, who your community is, where your community is, or where they hang out. Open source communities often gravitate to communication tools but this can be different for every project depending on your demographic. If you are unsure, sometimes it’s best to try a “wait and see” approach with multiple platforms. Then you can narrow things down based on the engagement and feedback you see.  

Questions to ask yourself when choosing:  
1. Should you use Single Sign-On based platforms? (Sign in with Google or Facebook)  

Many platforms give you the option to have a “sign in with Google or Facebook” feature. If you’re focusing on the software development or open source community, they may have an aversion to platforms that use single sign-on because it can often compromise a person’s privacy or security. However, if your project is more of a consumer facing app, this may be necessary.  

2. Should you gamify your community?  

Gamification allows you to add competitive gameplay and rewards to your community. Some platforms come with this functionality built in while others may need a third party tool. Either way this can be a great option to keep your community engaged.  

It should be mentioned that if you are offering monetary rewards, be aware of the side effects this can have. Often times people will join your community for the wrong reasons. That’s not to say monetary incentives don’t work, but you should be careful with how you deploy it. People will often try to take advantage of the system or leave when they feel they have extracted the maximum amount.  

3. How much should you focus on analytics and metrics?  

Some platforms offer a lot of paid services that give you a deeper understanding of your traffic, member activity, platform engagement and other useful data. This type of data mining may help a consumer facing project but your community may have an aversion to this depending on the demographic. Data mining is something you should be careful with in general especially with the new GDPR regulations that limit the information you can collect and store.  

Regulations like the GDPR may even make it a legal issue if you choose the wrong third party tools or platform. Do your research on what data you collect, how it’s stored as well as how that data is accessed.  

4. How much control do you have over your community and content?  

Building a community can be tough, the last thing you want is an unforeseen event that  impacts your engagement with your community. An example would be when Slack made the decision to start closing public communities down due to the spamming and scams. Slack may have a lot of features and be the go to platform for many people but an event like this could slow your community growth if unprepared. Some questions you need to ask yourself is  

* What moderation tools do I have to prevent spam and other malicious behavior?
* How much control do you have over how community member use your platform?
* What kind of scalability do you have and what costs are involved when scaling?
* If this project were to be placed in the hands of the community or a group of communities, how would that handoff occur and can you do it without the community falling apart?  

Platform Options  

There are many platforms to choose from but the following tools are the ones that Sourcerers has either considered or has used in some capacity. Before making a decision, it’s important to compare the vendors/platforms side-by-side and prioritize the list by features so you can see if those align with your overall project goals.  

Regardless of the chosen platform for building the community, it’s important to familiarize oneself with the moderation tools on a deep level before launching publicly. If testing new features is necessary, using a private channel is best so as to not disturb or confuse your community members.  

* [Slack](https://slack.com/) - A robust team communication/collaboration tool
Slack is a very stable hosted chat solution that’s free with some limitations but is hard to operate an open community due to its lack of moderation tools and lack of support for such use cases. It also has a lot of features unavailable without paying for the service. It also is a “pay per user” model making it unfeasible for large open communities unless you do significant screening of the people you invite as your primary moderation strategy. While you can use it for an exclusive group within an open community, it is typically marketed as an internal team tool. Slack may even close an account down without a strict screening of the people invited. This limits the ability for an open community to remain open. There are however moderation tools available but the shortcomings make it difficult to use as a primary option. And most certainly should be paired with another platform for screening.
* [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) - A simple chat platform with robust bots and other useful tools.
The developer community is always creating new bots for Telegram and there are a [multitude of different options](https://botlist.co/) to choose from in terms of moderation. It does however take a lot of trial and error to find what works best for your specific community. You will also have some ongoing costs to employ proper moderation and tools. After self hosting and creating a number of custom bots, Sourcerers has settled on using the hosted solution [‘Combot’](https://combot.org). Combot will satisfy nearly every moderation need from keyword blocking, URL whitelisting/blacklisting, reputation and ranking, automated removal of messages, and other tools you would expect. They also accept crypto currency as payment.
* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)- A free voice and text chat for desktop and phone.
Discord is by far the easiest and cheapest solution for creating an open community. Discord has decent “out of the box” moderation tools that is mostly role based. However, for features like advanced automation, ranking, reputation and other features, you will need to employ a few third party bots to get the functionality you would expect for moderation. Sourcerers currently uses the bots [‘Mee6’](https://mee6.xyz/) and [‘yagpdb’](https://yagpdb.xyz) for most of moderation functions. These bots also allow you to create a multi step onboarding process that slowly unlocks channels allowing you to keep a Discord server clean and simplified for new users, while limiting spam all the way through. The current structure Sourcerers employs is focused on an incentivized leveling system where new users gain access to channels and rewards by chatting or sharing content. Much of Discord’s branding does revolve around the gaming community and it may not be suitable for all projects. However, Discord is making a lot of advancements to reach beyond the gaming community. For example, they’re [big supporters of many open source projects](https://discordapp.com/open-source). They even display the projects on their website, giving your community some visibility.
* [RocketChat](https://rocket.chat/) - An open source alternative to Slack.
Rocketchat is a great open source alternative for projects seeking a full open source option. However Sourcerers has discontinued the use of Rocket Chat due to the limited demographic of users and recent regulatory changes focused on internal data retention. Rocketchat is fairly easy to setup but it is time consuming to self host and there is a small learning curve to doing this if you are new to Ubuntu and setting up cloud servers. You will need to be comfortable accessing things with an [SSH client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients) or from the Mac OSX command line to [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) into your server. You will need to know this to set up, maintain and operate your server.  

The savings compared to a hosted Rocket Chat solution are unparalleled so it is worth taking the time to do these things. You will however need to do a lot of [hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing)) and must focus on the security of your implementation. If you are in doubt about anything or run into an issue.  

* [Matrix (Riot Chat)](https://about.riot.im/) - An open source alternative to Slack tailored to open communities.
Matrix is an open standard built to facilitate interoperability and decentralised communications over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP, Internet of Things application or just general publishing/subscribing of data in a publicly accessible or private manner. Its completely open source and you can easily spin up a Riot Chat implementation to get an open community started. Many projects have begun migrating to Riot simply because of the open source nature of the platform. It is however not as user friendly and familiar as some of the closed source options mimicking the UI standards built by Slack, Discord and similar platforms.

* [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.org/) - An open source alternative to Slack tailored to open communities.  

Mattermost can be great for smaller teams and some open communities have even started to use it. However, in the long run, it may not be scalable unless you host your own instance and go through similar hardening and security that you would with a custom Rocketchat, Matrix, or Fleep implementation. This of course comes with maintenance and server costs that you will want to consider when aligning things with an open source project’s goals.  

[Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat)- A paid SAAS product similar to Slack tailored to open communities.  

Spectrum is a great choice for open communities however it is not open source and has a number of value added services you have to pay for as you begin to scale your community. This may be a great option depending on your specific project but may experience unforseen disruptions and issues considering it’s a centralized project that you have to rely on. Similar to other options, you will want to weigh the pros and cons of paying for a service like this and have a back up plan for migrating if you experience a disruption or discontinuation of the service. They do however have discounts for open source projects, non profits and educational communities. They also have a unique prorated pricing system for paid features not seen on other platforms.

* [Ryver](https://ryver.com/)- A paid SAAS product similar to Slack

Ryver is similar to Slack in a lot of ways but improves on communication in a number of ways. Most notably are the ability to have “threaded” conversations more like a forum or Reddit . It also has a lot of built in task tracking features that you would typically get from Trello. They have a more flexible pricing structure that is less restrictive than many of the “per user” pricing other platforms have. Like Slack this is not really built for open communities but could facilitate an open community with the “guest” feature.

* [Fleep](https://fleep.io/) - A paid SAAS product similar to Slack but tailored to open communities.

Fleep is a team communication platform similar to many others we have mentioned and has a familiar and easy to use UI that you would expect. Considering Fleep is also geared towards open communities, you may have a better experience with it than some of the other platforms/options. It also has many of the same features and integrations you would expect from Slack like Zapier, Sameroom etc. Fleep also gives users the option to have multiple channels for each team, similar to Slack and discord.

* [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/)- An open source alternative to Slack

Considering Zulip is open source, you can have a full featured self hosted version on your own server. This is similar to Rocketchat in that you will have to pay for server costs and maintenance but will give you a lot more control than a proprietary option. They do have fairly reasonable paid plans that supports the development of the open source platform.

* [Keybase](https://keybase.io/docs/teams/index) - A secure communication platform with PGP encryption built in

Keybase has a lot of features you would expect when wanting to communicate with individuals and teams, however there is a learning curve and hurdle to getting people up and running for an open community. However, in terms of security you really can’t beat having PGP encryption baked into the platform. The downside is, if a person is new to PGP, they could lose access to their profile requiring them to create a new one. Considering how secure Keybase is by design, you won’t have to do as much “hardening” as you would with other platforms.
Moderation Tips and Suggestions
After making a platform decision it’s time to think more about moderation based on the tools you have at your disposal. Let’s look at some scenarios and issues that are common when starting a community and ways you can deal with them.

* It’s important to monitor community operated channels and communities for possible opportunities to turn trolls and misinformation into a community building effort. As an example, In the early days of a community you may see a large influx of spam and negativity being propagated through the community. Reaching out to these people on a personal level can humanize your project and ensure people see you and your project “on their level” rather than a negative impersonal standpoint. This especially pertains to communities that double as a customer support portal. You never know what someone else is dealing with and it’s best to reach out and let them know your community rules but also get know them a bit and see how you can level with them.

* If you can’t level with people who are being disruptive on purpose, it’s best to be very strict and remove people quickly or do light bans (muting, demoting, or another available option). You then need to monitor the community ran channels to see what they say and take any opportunity you can to “hug a troll”. Again, reach out on a human level and respond to them when they express that they are upset over a ban or restriction. You will know quickly if they are simply having a bad day or are genuinely trolling. You will often find some of your more dedicated community members when you show this type of outreach.

* Another suggestion for handling your community if it’s growing fast and you have “fires to put out”, is to use bots with a “warn” feature. If your platform offers custom commands, It’s also a good idea to create one that pulls up the rules quickly. This empowers your community members and helps remind new people what's expected of the community. Often times this can seem less confrontational for another community member to share the rules rather than a moderator or admin
of a community. This will also go a long way in creating a positive community culture that keeps the conversations on track and within your guidelines.

#### Foreign language members
It’s often best to offer language specific channels for your community to keep each main chat channel organized. This is often an ongoing effort and will be different for every community. If someone does reach out about a specific language, we take feedback and gauge if it’s necessary to create a dedicated channel. We also and encourage those who reach out as well as multilingual community members to take a leadership or moderator role to facilitate the creation of those dedicated channels. In addition to our white paper and publications being translated, current examples of how Sourcerers supports other languages is as follows:

* Wechat  
WeChat is a great alternative to other platforms if you have community members who may not be able to access the other platforms in their region. Sourcerers currently maintains a Wechat server and community in an effort to cater to these users and to offer more multi language support. Sourcerers does have a dedicated moderator for Wechat to ensure the safety and enjoyment of its users. Having dedicated moderator and Wechat server will come with a number of ongoing costs.

* Discord
Discord was structured in a way that allows new members to select a language when first joining. We currently support English, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Some of the translations have been sourced directly from our community while others are done by dedicated moderators for those languages. Our Ambassadors have the option to take a leadership role for a specific language and become a dedicated moderator for that language. Considering this, we intend to expand beyond the current languages based on demand and requests from the ambassadors.

#### Resources and Tools
There are many bots for the various platforms we have mentioned in this guide but we will only cover the ones Sourcerers has or is currently using. Choosing specific tools will be an ongoing iterative process before you deploy it to your broader community. Often times a trial run with a small test group of your community can offer a great engagement opportunity and even establish solid core community members as you test some of these new tools.
Browser extensions

* [One Tab](https://www.one-tab.com/) Used for task consolidation and task switching. Great for multi tasking and jumping from issue to issue or project to project. This is great when you have to quickly switch gears due to an issue in the community and change tasks without losing your place or interrupting your workflow to deal with the issue at hand.
* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com)Used as a quick ‘Read later’ and time saver when the community shares and suggest content you don’t have time to look at right away. Going through this and following up with community member or conversations is a great way to spur discussion and engagement with you community.
* [Ethereum Gas Price Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethereum-gas-price-extens/innfmlnnhfcebjcnfopadflecemoddnp) - Great for keeping transactions as efficient as possible. This tool ensures community rewards are distributed as cheaply and efficiently as possible.
* [Autotext expander (Basic Text Macros)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-text-expander-for-go/iibninhmiggehlcdolcilmhacighjamp)
AutoText Expander is used to build markdown formatted responses for various chat platforms, including community rules and other preformatted responses and content. Each platform will require different variations of markdown so this makes it easy to have templates for each platform. A community needs human discussion more than it needs canned responses so this is purely used for readability and not automation.
* [Quickwrite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-write-text-editor/ngmbmhchieecdhfkpafcmnjonmckhdpj)
Quickwrite is a lightweight text editor for your browser that works when on the fly and needing to quickly take a note, format a response with Auto Text expander or you want to write something quickly and don’t want to use clunky apps like google docs.
* [Sortd](https://www.sortd.com/) - Email and efficiency tool.
Quickwrite is a Gmail extension that allows you to drag and drop your emails into custom lists (To do, working on, Done, Custom.) This is great for me keeping tabs on your emails in a clean and task based workflow. You can even snooze things, add notes, set reminders, tag and create boards for different workflows. You can also switch between normal gmail mode and Sortd mode if you need to.
* [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) Keep is a great tool to ensure notes and information is available on all devices so you can quickly and easily retrieve and respond to a community question.
Bots

* [Poll Bot](https://telegram.me/pollbot) Pollbot is a simple and effective polling bot for Telegram and is paired well with Facebook and Twitter Polling. You can get a community wide view on opinions/feedback.
* [Self Hosted Telegram bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots) Custom bots and the flexibility they afford can work well depending on how you have your community set up but it will be different for every community manager and come with a lot of trial and error. As a rule of thumb, It’s best to keep things simple and limit the bots you use unless you are prepared to learn how to host an maintain them. Custom bots will have a lot of maintenance and updates that often need to be done manually.
* [Sameroom](https://sameroom.io/) Sameroom can be useful during a transition from one platform to another or when linking various different community platforms. You will however want to experiment with various strategies to ensure you have the best structure for your community. Sameroom can be expensive and conflict with other bots too. It should be noted that Sameroom is limited in visual customization options. You will lack ability to relay avatar images and other identifying information about your community member leading to confusion at times.
* [Bot Father](https://botsfortelegram.com/project/the-bot-father/) Bot Father is a Telegram bot that can do any number of things, you can create your own FAQ bot, moderation bot, link other chats and even create games. This is your link to the powerful Telegram API and most bots you create will require you to use Bot FAther to acquire an API key.
* [Group Butler](https://t.me/groupbutler_bot) Group Butler is nice to have if you are just getting started and have very few moderators or time to moderate your chat, you can auto kick people, manage your group with rules, anti-flooding features, add group descriptions, custom triggers, and a lot of other useful features. While this can help in the earlier days of a community, it can be inconsistent and have a down time especially as your community begins to grow.
* [Facebook instant reply bot](https://www.facebook.com/help/1615627532020480/?ref=u2u) Great for funneling people to your primary community channels where you focus most of your efforts. You can take things to the next level with Chatfuel. It allows you to create smart response conversational flows for your bot with more advanced information and instructions.
* Rocketchat’s [SlackBridge](https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/import/slack/slackbridge/) Great tool for bridging your community if migrating from Slack.  

General Tools  

* [Express VPN](https://www.expressvpn.com) Great option while streaming, video conferencing or conducting other public events.
* [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) (PIA) Great option if you aren't live streaming or conducting video conferencing but it's not up to high bandwidth tasks.
* [Appear.in](https://appear.in/) Great for public facing meetings because it’s quick and easy for people to join without the need for accounts or registration.
* [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) Great way to operate an “open door policy” for the community if they have deep feedback, need guidance or are seeking advanced help with a pressing issue. It easily syncs with Google calendar and prevent scheduling conflicts.
* [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is a tool for aggregating data, engagement and information from social media. This gives you a steady stream of engagement into a single channel and is funneled into the ‘Admin’ channel in a chosen community building platform.
* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) Similar to IFTTT, Zapier is used to aggregate engagement from across the web into a single channel. However it’s also used to automate publications, live streams and partner project content into channels for the the community to enjoy. This is primarily done with Zapier’s RSS feed integration.
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) - Digital Ocean can be a powerful way to self host the Slack alternative Rocketchat but comes with a number of learning curves for some community managers but it is open source and may be a great option for some communities. As of right now Sourcerers has deprecated this strategy due to a number of considerations.

#### Community Structure
At the basic core of your community, you should always provide a safe environment for your members, limiting spam and scams at all fronts. It’s also important to give some core channels so people can have open discussions, access news and provide feedback.

Getting Started
There are many ways to structure a community but if you are just getting started, you will need the following channels as a bare minimum requirement:
* General community chat - Regardless of the platform you choose, you need to focus here first and make sure people have a place to voice their issues, opinions, and concerns openly. Start moderating either manually or implement automated tools offered by the platform you choose but get it started sooner than later.

* An Announcement channel - This is to ensure there is a central hub of information and should be a one way conversation for you to steer new people to when wanting to know more information.

* A community wide rule set and guidelines - This will guide the culture of your community and ensure your conversations stay on track. You will often have people try to hijack the conversation flow and discussion topics. If you don’t want specific topics, clearly state so and what is expected of new members.

* Secondary private chat - This ensures you have a general workspace for talking with your team, moderators, or other activity you may not want to be public facing.

* A secondary account on every platform for testing bots, new features or troubleshooting problems.

* Secondary user accounts - Be sure to reserve any names names you don’t want the public to use or enforce a name requirement using your platform moderation tools to ensure no one can pose as your project or team.

* A plan or structure to onboard moderators - This is something you want to think carefully about and you may not want to do it right away or in some cases not at all. However, you do want a plan or policy in place early on because it will help as you scale and find the need to onboard community members to help out.
Community lead initiatives and channels
Foreign language community members
* It’s often best to have language specific channels on each platform and to encourage this as a community lead initiative, as coverage for every language is not feasible. When someone does reach out, you can use Google translate to bridge the language barrier and they will often do the same. You can then direct them to the channel specific to their language. This will help keep your community organized for new community members as your following grows.
Topic Specific Sub Communities
* Similar to having language specific channels, it’s best to separate your community into topic specific channels or even encourage community members to host entirely separate servers so things stay on topic and are well organized for your immediate community needs and goals. Be sure let the public know these are community lead initiatives if directing people to those places.
Unofficial chat rooms
* Often times your community may already have community lead initiatives like the ones we describe above. This should be encouraged even if you aren’t always active in those channels you should pop in from time to time. Often times, your best community members can come from these community lead initiatives. Monitoring those community lead channels and reaching out to an individual to address a misunderstanding is also a great way to build a long lasting connection with your community.

#### Strategies and Suggestions
It’s important to establish strategies that lead you towards goals that align with the organization/project goals at large. Before beginning your planning and strategy stages, it will be important to get all team members involved in this process to ensure the project goals and community strategies are aligned.

For more on strategy, see how Sourcerers [approaches community building](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBrhCEyj1aaMHk8POS04t7HpDVVE8yQsR7v1Ur6y-zQ/edit?usp=sharing) using what’s known as a Community Commitment Curve. This strategy is standard community building strategy used in many industries. This strategy is core to ensuring your community is a self sustaining ecosystem and builds a feedback loop through a clear roadmap for members. It can be accomplished in many ways but Sourcerers currently uses tools like gamification, recognition systems, engagement rewards and other incentives.

This strategy is important for OSS projects because your end goal should be to create a self sustaining ecosystem of contributors. Many communities and businesses use the ‘Commitment Curve’ strategy but it will be a bit different for an OSS project, so adjust accordingly based on the first section of this document labeled ‘OSS Community Management Differentiation’.
