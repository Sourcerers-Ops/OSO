# Live Streaming  

This guide will serve as a general operational overview of how to get started live streaming. We will also cover all the tools and hardware needed as well as best practices. Using live streaming to build a community is a powerful and rewarding endeavor, however it will take a lot of trial and error. Many of the tools and options are evolving and nothing is standardized right now. To get a general overview of all hardware, tools, and strategies, a live stream was conducted giving [educational overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsK3V1Cgrmo) of how an individual can start their own live stream. The slides and content used in this video can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rGTXrmiS2-85BamMe2HPfxNkeuvwNPDm3B-gIDJ_6Gs/edit?usp=sharing). This stream is produced for the [district0x community](https://discord.gg/Gjvw7qU) and gives a behind the scenes look of the operational approach Sourcerers uses when producing live content.

## Software and Tools
For an overview of the tools described below, see the [‘Software and Setup’](https://youtu.be/FsK3V1Cgrmo?t=44m3s) section of the educational stream. These are the current tools that Sourcerers uses when producing a stream. As mentioned before, nothing is standardized and these tools are subject to change often. You should be experimenting with as many tools as you can because the live streaming community is changing fast and new things emerge all the time. Watch other streams and see what people are talking about and using. You may find a hidden gem you can incorporate into your live stream.

## Streaming Software  

There are many software options for live streaming, however the following two are fairly standard and give all the features and needs to get started professionally or as a hobby.

## Streaming Platforms
Each of this has features that may work better depending on your needs and use case. However, Sourcerers takes the multi streaming strategy using Restream.io. This does however make your streaming setup more involved but you will capture more of an audience if you go to your audience rather than making them come to you. Having backup streams is also great if a streaming service shuts off your stream or goes down. Which happens to even the largest youtube stars and streaming channels. It’s also good to give your viewers options so they never miss your stream.

### Platform Pros and Cons

### [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/)  
#### Pros:
1. Twitch is useful for people who may like to watch the stream but don’t like Mixer.

### [Streaming “How To” Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsK3V1Cgrmo&feature=youtu.be&t)  
When conducting a live stream you will have an endless stream of options and it’s easy to get lost in the weeds. It’s best to start with what you have and take feedback so you can scale things up from there. There is no sense in buying the best lighting and equipment if you are doing simple community streams.

However, if you are getting into more advanced production, you may need a more powerful setup. You may even need your setup to be mobile. Regardless of your needs, it’s best to think about your equipment needed first. The educational live stream we linked in the beginning of this document will go into the following aspects of live streaming to get someone started and then get into an example of how a live interview stream is produced.

[Equipment](https://youtu.be/FsK3V1Cgrmo?t=6m25s)  
While there are a number of options for a live streaming computer, the most important thing is limiting your down time and having a backup. In the live stream we cover three option, a single PC setup, a dual PC setup and a mobile rig. It ultimately boils down to how you as an individual are wanting to stream and what you are streaming. Some people need to conduct interviews, others may want to do presentations with a green screen, while some may need to be on the go covering live events. This is all up to the individual and takes a lot of research as well as trial and error. However, the hardware section of the live stream recording will cover much of what you need to get started.

[Software and Setup](https://youtu.be/FsK3V1Cgrmo?t=43m50s)  
There are a lot of considerations for software, bots and tools for making your stream the best it can be. This takes the most time out of anything else and often times will make or break a stream, don’t skimp here. Dive in on your free time and really try to have fun here, if you have fun setting things up, your viewers will see that you are having fun and likely have fun too. Not to mention you can conduct giveaways, track engagement, and gamify your stream, making something truly special for people.

[Behind the Scenes of ‘The District Digest’](https://youtu.be/FsK3V1Cgrmo?t=52m51s)  
In this section we dive into the internal process of how the district0x community stream was produced when conducting interviews, how we market the stream, and what it takes before, during, and after. There is quite a bit to streaming that most people never see and this gives a sneak peek. You will have days when you don’t get everything done or something goes wrong; this is all part of it. Don’t worry about the issues, often times your viewers will be understanding and even offer to help if it’s as simple as sending out a tweet or two.

[Software Tutorial](https://youtu.be/FsK3V1Cgrmo?t=1h3m43s)  
In this section we cover many of the basics of setting up scenes, audio, video, cameras, plugins, and the various features of OBS as well as Xsplit, two of the more popular streaming platforms. If you are familiar with photoshop and layers, much of this will come as second nature. The hard part is getting all this ready long before you go live, so you aren’t scrambling to get ready as you go live. Preparation is everything.

### Live Interview Production
In this section we will cover a standard operating procedure (SOP) for a live interview stream that Sourcerers produces for the district0x community.Interviews are conducted through [https://whereby.com/user](https://whereby.com/user) to reduce friction with getting guests live, as no account is needed. The stream’s video feed is used as the camera in Appear.in, so the guest can easily read and interact with the live chat without leaving Appear.in. The first five minutes of stream is an introduction to the guest/project as well as relevant or important news/content.

A participation tracking bot called [ScorpBot](https://scorpbot.com/) is used to reward viewers with points that can be redeemed for various rewards, moderation privileges, exclusive access, swag etc. Viewers need to be logged in to participate/earn stream rewards.

About the Show
Originally, the show was produced as a single weekly online meetup exclusively for the district0x community called ‘The District Digest’. The show started as a community curated show and has since evolved into two separate shows called ‘The District Roundup’ and ‘The Dapp Digest’.

The District Roundup holds true to the original format of news and updates within the district0x project, while ‘The Dapp Digest’ now covers broader aspects of the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem. The shows air live on [Mixer.com](https://mixer.com/district0x); while simultaneously being broadcast to additional live streaming outlets including [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/district0x/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/district0x), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/district0x) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQq0INymkcGDYYXeFZgYk4g).

All completed streams are available on YouTube so they can be accessed by anyone who missed the original broadcast.

## **Pre-Stream (Streamer)**

### Tips and Suggestions
1. Take feedback - It’s important to listen to your audience (and guests), if you notice specific content doing better than others or if you feel like the audience is bored, liven things up by taking feedback, giving people bots to use during stream or even giving them control of some aspect of the stream. The single most powerful aspect of a live stream is that people can interact, unlike youtube videos.

2. Be dynamic - Experiment with time slots, it’s hard to gauge who and where your primary audience will be until you get going for a while. After you start getting viewers, you can look at your analytics and see where people are and what devices they are using to adjust your content and schedule accordingly.

3. Interactivity - If you choose a streaming platform that is limited on interactive features, you may want to find other ways to engage your audience by either providing links in chat to Trello boards, user feedback polls or contests.

4. Context - If using a gaming focused stream platform like Twitch or Mixer, be aware of the community guidelines and set your stream titles and category to ‘Podcast’ to ensure people know what type of content they are getting into.

5. Appreciation - If you only have a few viewers, try to show them you appreciate their time and attention. Often times you will retain them as a dedicated moderator and community member. It’s important to focus on quality over quantity with your viewers.

6. Immerse yourself - Get involved in other streams that may be doing similar content, support them if they are independent content creators. If they represent a project or company, share their channel and show them support too. The streaming community is often willing to help but they are small and resourceful. Most people are willing to give you a mention and talk about your content to their viewers. Word of mouth can go a long way.

7. Raiding - A common activity the streaming community will do is “raid” another person’s channel. This is when one broadcast ends and instructs all their viewers to join and often spam chat. This can often be disruptive but also bring new viewers and fans to your channel. If you are not wanting this type of activity, be sure to add a note in your channel rules that you don’t want raids.

8. Trolling - Do not give trolls the time of day, if you get a troll don’t react, respond or comment. Simply remove them and pretend it’s not happening. Their goal is to get a reaction and a response and they will get bored if you pretend it’s not happening.

9. Moderators - Give your viewers a path to becoming a mod and reward them for it. Often times you can do moderator only giveaways and rewards. Give your moderators some ground rules so they know when to ban people, what you think is okay, how you handle trolls, what access and commands they have to your bots, what they should and should not say, etc.

10. Make a List - A checklist will be your best friend when streaming. There is a lot to remember when conducting a stream, you will want to simplify your process as much as possible. This will help you build it as a habit but in the beginning you will need that check list. Until you have moderators and other people to help, automate everything you can. Do be mindful of how your automated posts work, spamming people can quickly make people unfollow you.  

### Community Currency and Loyalty Store

As a content request we will describe in detail how to create a community currency, Web3 loyalty store, and fun ways to build a rewarding experience for your viewers like we have on the [Dapp Digest](https://dappstream.live/cloudbot). This does require you to have a budget to deploy this but it's worth it when you see how powerful of a Web3 onboarding tool this can be. This could obviously be done in a more custom way (and should be) but this is a bare bones MVP anyone can do without development skills. You can also prototype community currency and Web3 concepts before actually deploying them on Ethereum from the comfort of your streaming community. 

#### What you will need
* A Streamlabs account and [Creator Website](https://streamlabs.com/creator-sites) - Allows you to host the store and official website for your stream 
* A free account on [Bit.ly](Bit.ly) - This is to shorten reward links
* You must be familiar with [Link Drop](https://linkdrop.io/) - This is how you distribute your Web3 assets without the user paying gas
* You must be familiar with [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) or a similar tool. - Mainly to make onboarding to Metamask easy

#### Steps
1. Create your Streamlabs website. It's fast and easy to do with a drag and drop interface. This can be done in an afternoon and it's fun!
2. Go to your Streamlabs community [currency dashboard](https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/cloudbot/loyalty/settings) and setup your currency distribution preferences. Imagine as though this is an actual crypto currency. This may be the harder part depending on if you are using a mainnet token or a yet to be launched one. Never give out more than you can afford.
3. Create your redemption links in Link Drop. Make these for various different Web3 assets and for your Ethereum token (If already launched) 
4. Shorten these links using bit.ly to track and monitor your links. This can help keep the links neat for your community and to track people exploiting your rewards links. Don't make too many of these just in case they are comprimised at some point. You can easily make more as you need them. 
4. Now get your "loot box" images. There are many you can use online, buy from an artist by posting a job to Ethlance, or you can make your own in photoshop. These are just for astetics but they are eye catching and exciitng for your viewers. Especially younger users. 
5. Now go to your [Loyalty store dashboard](https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/cloudbot/store/items) and add your store items. Select the 'Access Code' option for item type. Then add a Title, Description, Cost, Quantity of links you have, and leave the cooldowns as is (Unless you want to have a longer cooldown before this can be used). Now click 'Next'. 6. On your 'Thumbnail image, add your 'Loot Box' graphic, then add your shortened redemption links along with a [sound effect](https://www.myinstants.com/index/us/) if you want it to fire off on your stream (Be sure to add your streamlabs overlay to your OBS sources so your viewers can see it live.
7 Now add all of your shortened redemption links and check each of the options 'Redeem Shows Alert, Dispense Access Codes randomly, Remove Code once redeemed, Redeem Via Chat. Then add a command for people using text to redeem. Now click 'Next'
8. Now add additional requirements if you desire. (Email, Ethereum address, Discord name, etc) and hit the 'Save' button. 
9. Be sure you added your loyalty store module to your Streamlabs Creator Website. It's in the drag and drop component list. You may also want to add your leaderboard so your viewers can see where they stand. 

That's it. Now your cloud bot page will show this item and your community can redeem it if they have a Web3 enabled wallet. You may want to create a tutorial with Typeform to help people install Metamask or a mobile Web3 wallet like we did in our store as the 'Noob Quest': https://dappstream.live/cloudbot
