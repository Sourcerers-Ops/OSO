# Open Source Operations

Welcome to the Sourcerers.io 'Open Source Operations' project. This repository represents an initiative designed to document and catalogue the various processes conducted by the Sourcerers.io team, a strategic advising consultancy with expertise in branding and marketing. While direct contributions are tentatively limited to team members, we freely encourage suggestions and feedback from all.

Github was chosen as a home for this project precisely due to the ease with which this work can be replicated and line-edited. All initialized documents are or will be prepared in spell-and-grammar-correcting clients before being formatted into markdown according to the [styles guide](https://github.com/Sourcerers-Ops/OSO/blob/master/styles.md). Each file will live in one of the initialized folders, described below.

##### Directories

Our initial directories are modeled off of the service types we provide as a team. Below they are listed alongside brief descriptions of their content scope.

+ **Community Management** - Instructions sets and primers around online community building, including chat moderation, live streaming, bounty campaign building, product support, and generally anything requiring end-user engagement.
+ **Marketing** - Social media management practices and scheduling, search engine optimization techniques, branding guidelines, content creation and planning, and anything else intended to bring new eyes to our clientsâ€™ offerings.
+ **Operations & Administration** - All material required to provide sourcing, hiring, contracting and payroll support for our clients.
+ **Strategy** - All other high level policies and documentation influencing the advisory arm of Sourcerers.io.


Several additional root-level and many sub-directories are expected to be added in the future.
